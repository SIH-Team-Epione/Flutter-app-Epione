const learnMoreText = 'A student''s life is largely governed of their school or university related work. Be it a high school student or a college going student, studies, projects, internships etc. take up most of their time. We wanted to factor in this aspect in our app as we strongly believe that this component is of equal significance when we talk about self care. Hence, we decided to add this unique dimension to our app dividing the features into two, namely, time management and concentration techniques. Head over to their pages to learn more about them!';
